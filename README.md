# Identicon

Github uses [identicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) for anyone without a profile picture.<sup><a href="https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons/">identicons - github.blog</a></sup>

An identicon is basically a visual representation of a hash value. But since github's identicon algorithm is not in public domain, this is a _simple C++ implementation which uses random values_ to generate an identicon.
